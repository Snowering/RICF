	abstract = {This paper provides technical details and user guidance of the Research Infrastructure of Chinese Foundations (RICF), a database for academic research on Chinese foundations. The database structure (Database Schema) of RICF is deliberately designed, normalized and the data is updated according to standardized workflow and file formats. Data quality of RICF is controlled by four criteria: data source reputation and believability, completeness, accuracy, and timeliness. The availability of the RICF enables users to study the critical questions about Chinese foundations. RICF is exclusively for academic purposes and is not allowed for commercial use. All the materials are available online through RICFâ€™s official website. This manual is updated routinely, and the latest version can be accessed through SSRN.},
